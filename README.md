## About The Project

This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase my skills and experience as a developer. It leverages a modern technology stack, including Django for the backend, React for the frontend, and NGINX for serving the application. It also incorporates CI/CD practices for efficient development and deployment, even as a solo developer.
