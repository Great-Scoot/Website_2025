Workflow for dev -> staging -> prod?
    - Pass system_configuration client side (done)
    - Work on bash scripting (stage_latest.sh, stage_to_prod.sh, & others)
        - Switch to Postgres. (done)
        - Rebuild docker container (done)
        - PICKUP HERE:
            - Update secret.env, setup ssh stuff, clone git, setup postgres, migrate & runserver (python), see if stage_latest.sh will work better.
        - How to update ENV_WEBSITE_MODE related to staging vs production?
        - How to stop/start/restart servers (gunicorn, nginx, & python)?
            - NGINX maintenance page?
            - Test process via Docker?
        - Clean up process to remove undesireable files from prod server like todo.txt, notes.txt, etc.
    - Create and show maintenance page

How to handle dev vs prod stuff (API Only vs API + HTML/REACT)?
    - On droplet:
        - Setup NGINX, GUINCORN, & GIT.
        - Update and test deploy.sh
            - Only npm install production dependencies (webpack will be needed but not webpack-dev-server)
            - Remove source code before restarting servers?
