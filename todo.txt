Pass ENV_WEBSITE_VERSION to client-side

How to handle dev vs prod stuff (API Only vs API + HTML/REACT)?
    - On droplet:
        - Setup NGINX, GUINCORN, & GIT.
        - Update and test deploy.sh
            - Only npm install production dependencies (webpack will be needed but not webpack-dev-server)
            - Remove source code before restarting servers?
