== TO DO ==

Workflow for dev -> prod?
    - Make more data driven:
        - Use /api/slider-items?page_name=portfolio
            - Conditionally render <Sliders /> (done)
            - Expired entries should not be clickable (done)
            - Use external_url (done)
            - Add <WebDevPreview /> and remove hard coded components (done)
            - Update model for slider items
                - Add description and external_url_text (done)
                - Add order. Don't sort API response by order. Instead, render components according to order (sort slidesArray, store in component state) (done)
        - Store time in GMT (done)
        - Remove source/public images (done)
