== TO DO ==

Update settings.py to handle dev vs prod (API Only vs API + HTML/REACT)
    - webpack:dev will need API to query. In prod, Python could include data in the response, or the client could fetch the data. What is best?
    - How can python run on port 80/443?
        - SSL stuff?
CMD to bundle for prod && then start Python?
Pass ENV_WEBSITE_VERSION to client-side
    - Pass other stuff?
Easy way to deploy to cloud?
    - migrations?
    - Only include prod stuff.
